# About

This is a sample project for the npm library `trool`. This is an event total price calculator in which we have groups of visitors and tickets. The total price for a group is calculated by adding up the ticket cost for each visitor in that group. The cost for a ticket varies based on the vistor's age and the size of the group they are in. We use `trool` and a csv file to dynamically update the discount applied to each vistor's ticket.
